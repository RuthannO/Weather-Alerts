Large breaking waves will\nresult in localized beach/dune structure erosion and dangerous\nswimming conditions.

Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",

                "instruction": "There is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

Large breaking waves will\nresult in localized beach/dune structure erosion and dangerous\nswimming conditions. FOR THE HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK, rip\ncurrents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into\ndeeper water, where it becomes difficult to return to safety.",

Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",

This represents a decrease in probabilities due to snow\nmelt during the first half of March\n\nThis outlook covers Chippewa and Mackinac counties in eastern Upper\nMichigan which includes the Pine River Basin...and the northern half\nof Lower Michigan encompassing Au Sable...Boardman...Manistee...\nRifle...and Tobacco River basins.\n\nThe first table below lists the probabilities of reaching flood stage\n(minor flooding)...as well as moderate and major flood levels for the\nsix forecast points within the Gaylord National Weather Service office\nHydrologic Service Area. Current (CS) and historical (HS) probabilities\nof exceeding minor...moderate...and major flood stages are listed\nfor the valid time period. CS values indicate the probability of\nreaching a flood category based on current conditions.\n\nHS values indicate the probability of reaching a flood category based\non historical or normal conditions.\n\nWhen the value of CS is greater than HS: the probability of exceeding\nthat level is higher than normal.\n\nWhen the value of CS is less than HS: the probability of exceeding\nthat level is lower than normal.\n\n...Table 1--Probabilities for minor...moderate and major flooding...\nValid Period:  03/17/2025 - 06/15/2025\n\n:    Current and Historical\n:     Chances of Exceeding\n:       Flood Categories\n:      as a Percentage (%)\nCategorical      :\nFlood Stages (FT)   :   Minor    Moderate   Major\nLocation           Minor   Mod   Major :  CS   HS   CS   HS   CS   HS\n--------           -----  -----  ----- : ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---\n:Manistee River\nSherman             15.0   16.0   17.0 :  16   12   <5   <5   <5   <5\n:Boardman River\nMayfield--Brown B    7.0    8.0    9.0 :  <5   <5   <5   <5   <5   <5\n:Au Sable River\nRed Oak              7.0    8.0    9.0 :   5   12   <5   <5   <5   <5\n:Rifle River\nSterling             6.0   11.0   13.0 :  33   64   <5   <5   <5   <5\n:Pine River\nRudyard             17.0   19.0   20.0 :  <5   <5   <5   <5   <5   <5\n:Tobacco River\nBeaverton           12.0   14.0   17.0 :  <5   <5   <5   <5   <5   <5\n\nLegend\nCS = Conditional Simulation (Current Outlook)\nHS = Historical Simulation\nFT = Feet\n\nDeparture from normal of reaching flood stage is the difference between\nthe current projected chance for reaching flood stage (CS) and the\nclimatological normal (HS). For example...the Manistee River near\nSherman...with a Flood Stage of 15 feet...has a 16 percent chance\nof reaching or exceeding flood stage. This is 4 percentage points\nabove normal.

The long range\nprobabilistic outlooks given in the above tables contain forecast\nvalues that are calculated using multiple season scenarios from 30\nor more years of climatological data...and incorporated current\nriver levels...soil moisture conditions...snow water equivalent\nvalues...as well as 30 and 90 day outlooks for temperature and\nprecipitation provided by the NOAA/NWS Climate Prediction Center.\nActual river crests will differ from this outlook if future\nconditions differ significantly from forecast conditions...or if\nice jams develop.\n\n...Current Conditions...\n\nRecent rain and snow melt have reduced the likelihood going forward\nof additional flooding due to melting snow...especially across\nnorthern Lower Michigan.\n\nPrecipitation through the Summer months (June-August) was\ngenerally from 75 to 125 percent of normal. Across eastern Upper\nMichigan June was the wettest month of the summer with\nprecipitation 150 to 200+ percent of normal...things started to\ndry out in July with below normal rainfall though most areas\nreceived at least 50 percent of normal precipitation. A similar\ntrend was noted in August. Precipitation during the Fall months\n(September-November) started out below normal for September (less\nthan 50 percent of normal with some areas less than 25 percent of\nnormal) and October (25 to 75 percent of normal). But November\nprecipitation was above normal in most locations...more than 200\npercent of normal across northern Chippewa county and in the\nhigher terrain of eastern Antrim/western Otsego/northwest Kalkaska\ncounties mainly due to a significant lake effect snow event\nduring Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPrecipitation for the Winter (December through February) featured\nquite a bit of snowfall for the lake effect snowbelts. The\nGaylord NWS office set a new record snowfall for the winter of\n149.5 inches. Sault Ste. Marie recorded its second snowiest winter\non record (138.9 inches)...Houghton Lake its third snowiest\nwinter (72.2 inches) and Traverse City tied its fourth snowiest\nwinter (125.1 inches). From a liquid equivalent precipitation\nstandpoint...Sault Ste. Marie recorded its 7th wettest winter on\nrecord (9.94 inches/3.42 inches above normal).\n\nSnow water equivalent in the snow pack across eastern Upper Michigan\nis generally 3 to 4 inches across Mackinac and southeast Chippewa\ncounty...and from 6 to 9 inches across the remainder of Chippewa\ncounty. Across northern Lower snow water equivalent is less than 2\ninches in areas that still have snow cover...and 1 to 3 inches\nacross areas of northwest Lower that still have snow cover.\n\nSoil moisture is near normal across all of northern Michigan.\nStreamflows on northern Michigan rivers are near normal thanks to\nrecent rain-on-snowmelt.\n\nD2 (Severe) Drought conditions continue across parts of Leelanau...\nAlpena...Benzie...Oscoda...Alcona...Manistee...Ogemaw...Iosco...\nGladwin...and Arenac counties.\n\nModerate (D1) Drought conditions also continue across parts of\nPresque Isle...Montmorency...Grand Traverse...Kalkaska...Crawford...\nWexford...Missaukee...and Roscommon counties.\n\n...Weather Outlook...\n\nThe 6 to 10 day outlook issued by the Climate Prediction Center\nvalid for the period of March 18-9 2025 is indicating a high\nlikelihood for above normal temperatures...and leaning toward\nabove normal precipitation.\n\nThe outlook for the Spring (March through May) indicates no\ndiscernible trend with regard to temperatures (equal probabilities\nfor above...normal...and below normal temperatures)...and a 40 to 50\npercent chance of above normal precipitation.\n\n...Additional Information...\n\nThis is the final Spring Flood Outlook for 2025. Long range\nprobabilistic outlooks such as those given in the above tables are\nissues during the last week of each month throughout the year.\n\nVisit water.noaa.gov/wfo/apx for more river information...including\ngraphs of the probabilistic information given in the above tables...\nthe latest observed conditions on northern Michigan streams...as\nwell as analyses of precipitation and snowfall.",
